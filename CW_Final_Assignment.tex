\section{Git and GitHub}
    \subsection{Repository Initialization and Commits}
    
To initialize the repository and make the first commits, the following steps were taken :

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Logged into \textbf{GitHub} and created a new repository named :
    \begin{verbatim}
    CW_Final_Assignment
    \end{verbatim}

    \item Configured the repository settings :
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Set the repository visibility to \textbf{Public}.
        \item Checked the box: \texttt{Initialize this repository with a README}.
    \end{itemize}

    \item Cloned the repository to the local system using the command :
    \begin{verbatim}
    git clone https://github.com/username/CW_Final_Assignment
    \end{verbatim}

    \item Navigated to the cloned repository directory :
    \begin{verbatim}
    cd CW_Final_Assignment
    \end{verbatim}

    \item Created a new LaTeX file named \texttt{CW\_Final\_Assignment.tex} with the initial structure.

    \item Staged and committed the new file :
    \begin{itemize}
        \item To stage the file:
        \begin{verbatim}
        git add CW_Final_Assignment.tex
        \end{verbatim}
        \item To commit the changes:
        \begin{verbatim}
        git commit -m "Added initial LaTeX file"
        \end{verbatim}
    \end{itemize}

    \item Pushed the changes to the GitHub repository :
    \begin{verbatim}
    git push
    \end{verbatim}
\end{enumerate}

    \subsection{GitHub Actions for LaTeX Compilation}
    To streamline the process of compiling the LaTeX document and managing different stages of updates, two distinct GitHub Actions workflows were created:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Workflow for Intermediate Versions:}
        This workflow compiles the LaTeX document and uploads the resulting PDF as an \textbf{Artifact}. It is used for minor updates or ongoing progress, ensuring the document is accessible for review without cluttering the Releases section.
    
        \item \textbf{Workflow for Major Releases:}
        This workflow compiles the LaTeX document and publishes the resulting PDF as part of a \textbf{GitHub Release}. It is triggered only for significant updates or finalized versions to provide stable releases for public access.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsubsection{Workflow for Intermediate Versions (Artifact Only)}

For intermediate updates or minor progress, the LaTeX document is compiled and uploaded as an \textbf{Artifact}. This ensures that ongoing work is accessible for review and testing without cluttering the Releases section.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Trigger:} This workflow runs on every \texttt{push} to the \texttt{main} branch.
    \item \textbf{Outcome:} The compiled PDF is stored in the \textbf{Actions > Artifacts} section for download.
    \item \textbf{Workflow Configuration:}
    \begin{verbatim}
    name: Compile LaTeX and Upload Artifact

    on:
      push:
        branches:
          - main

    jobs:
      build_latex:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - name: Checkout Repository
            uses: actions/checkout@v3

          - name: Compile LaTeX Document
            uses: xu-cheng/latex-action@v2
            with:
              root_file: CW_Final_Assignment.tex

          - name: Upload Compiled PDF as Artifact
            uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
            with:
              name: CW_Final_Assignment
              path: ./CW_Final_Assignment.pdf
    \end{verbatim}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Workflow for Major Releases}

For significant updates or final versions, the LaTeX document is compiled, and the resulting PDF is published as part of a \textbf{GitHub Release}. This approach ensures that only stable and finalized versions are available in the Releases section.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Trigger:} This workflow runs on every \texttt{push} of a Git tag in the format \texttt{x.x.x} (e.g., \texttt{1.0.0}).
    \item \textbf{Outcome:} The compiled PDF is attached to a new Release in the \textbf{Releases} section.
    \item \textbf{Workflow Configuration:}
    \begin{verbatim}
    name: Release Compiled PDF

    on:
      push:
        tags:
          - '*.*.*'

    jobs:
      build_latex:
        permissions: write-all
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - name: Checkout Repository
            uses: actions/checkout@v3

          - name: Compile LaTeX Document
            uses: xu-cheng/latex-action@v2
            with:
              root_file: CW_Final_Assignment.tex

          - name: Create Release
            id: create_release
            uses: actions/create-release@v1
            env:
              GITHUB_TOKEN: \${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
            with:
              tag_name: \${{ github.ref }}
              release_name: Release \${{ github.ref }}
              draft: false
              prerelease: false

          - name: Upload Release Asset
            id: upload_release_asset
            uses: actions/upload-release-asset@v1
            env:
              GITHUB_TOKEN: \${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
            with:
              upload_url: \${{ steps.create_release.outputs.upload_url }}
              asset_path: ./CW_Final_Assignment.pdf
              asset_name: CW_Final_Assignment.pdf
              asset_content_type: application/pdf
    \end{verbatim}
\end{enumerate}
